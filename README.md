Case Study: Canadian FinTech company - Wingocard

Founded in 2019 by Mehdi Mehni, Salvatore D'Agostino and Sebastien Brault. In 2019, there was early traction around leveraging technology to serve families with their finances. The founders noticed one demographic that banks and traditional financial players largely ignored: teenagers.

Having two teenage sons, Sebastien Brault, one of the 3 founders, and an angel investor, understood the challenges of family finance: whether it be the inconvenience of handing over his credit card every time there was a need to buy something online, having no proactive controls, or managing cash allowances with limited visibility into where it is spent. The 3 founders started researching by interviewing teens and parents, they found a consistent pain point for both, which was needing to find a better way for teens to spend online in a growing digital world and that is how Wingocard was born.

Wingocard has raised a total of $1.7M in funding over 1 round. This was a Seed round raised on May 19, 2021.

With nearly 53% of children in the United States now owning a smartphone by the age of 11 and consumer spending shifting online, it became clear that “teen banking” would become ubiquitous in the coming years. Wingocard developed an investment thesis for a mobile-first banking application that fit both parents and their kids’ needs, assembled a team and decided to partner with Diagram Ventures an Angel investor.  They validated the value proposition with a landing page and waitlist. Not only did it resonate with parents, kids believed that a “teen bank” was necessary, and the waitlist grew to more than 75,000 people. 

In most banks in Canada, you can only open a teen checking account when your child is 13. One parent is usually required to be a joint owner until the child turns 18. As a joint owner, the parent has the ability to monitor and access this account if they wish. The banks encourage the teenagers to keep track of their account and check their balance regularly. If a teenager fails to keep track of their account, they might not realize the rate at which they are spending, which means they could run the risk of declined or returned transactions, overdraft fees, or minimum balance fees.

Wingocard aims to instill financial literacy from a young age and is designed to help teens learn how to save, budget, and understand how to manage their money. Their solution is a collaborative banking app which is linked to a Visa debit card. Teens will have access to the cashless economy without requiring the use of their parent’s credit card. The wingocard app allows parents to transfer spending money to their teens while monitoring their purchases. It is free to sign up through the Wingocard app, and teens aged 13 and older can link their account to a parent or guardian’s bank account. Wingocard allows teens to seamlessly request money from their parents, manage their finances in the app, and make purchases with their Wingocard Visa Debit card. Teens can also use the app to receive an allowance and learn to manage their finances while gaining a sense of financial autonomy. With features including no overdraft fees, FDIC-insured funds, and industry-leading security, parents have additional peace of mind.

Wingocard is actively using 19 technologies for its website, according to BuiltWith. These include Viewport Meta, IPhone / Mobile Compatible, and SSL by Default.

The domain that Wingocard operates in could be categorised as Unbanked/underbanked – these are services that seek to serve disadvantaged or low-income individuals who are ignored or underserved by traditional banks or mainstream financial services companies. In this case the company noticed one demographic that banks and traditional financial players largely ignored: teenagers.
Although opening a bank account might be a rite of passage for people around the world, a significant portion of the global population either doesn’t have any form of bank account or doesn’t use a bank for a notable portion of their financial needs. People who are unbanked or underbanked tend to use alternative forms of financial services, such as check-cashing outlets, payday lenders, and money orders to handle their monetary needs. The last 5-10 years has seen major trends and innovations in this domain as traditional banks and Fintechs compete to reach the unbanked/underbanked. Innovations have included creation of Mobile Apps that give people access to their account information, the ability to transfer money within accounts, pay bills and deposit paper check using a mobile banking app;  decrease reliance on physical branches, this has been aided by innovative ways used to verify identities, such as biometrics or two-factor authentication, which have made it possible for a financial institution to offer services online or through a mobile app that once needed to be performed on-site; and offering prepaid products to customers as an effective way to convince currently unbanked individuals to begin to use other services, such as opening a saving or checking account.

Wingocard's top competitors include Spiral Financial, a company that develops a finance application intended to provide banking and giving services; TransferFriend, a company that develops a financial application offering cross-border digital money transfers; Rewire, a company developing a mobile banking platform for international cash transfers and Betalo, a fintech company specializing in mobile payments.

The core metrics that these competitors use to measure success is mainly social and human capital metrics. That is how many employees/ top talents they can afford to hire; how many twitter followers and the average likes per tweet these followers bring. Rewire currently has 128 employees, followed by Wingocard with 14 and in terms of percentage of tweets with engagement, Wingocard has a score of 100% followed by Spiral Financial.
